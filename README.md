This is the website and associated scripts that is used by VEX Robotics team 9573X to keep track of the engineering notebook.\
In the future, it is planned to use a custom rust-based web server (currently in [this folder](unused_for_now/)).\
However, for the time being it is being served using [nginx open-source](https://nginx.org/en/) on a Pi 4 8gb.\
You can find the website (if it is up) at [apexnotebook.ml](http://apexnotebook.ml).\
The site uses [w3.css](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp) for some styling and PHP for form handling.\
