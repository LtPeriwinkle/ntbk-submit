    <h1 class="epilogue">how to submit</h1>
    <h4><strong>PLEASE</strong> read this guide before submitting!</h4>
    <p>Since this notebook will be submitted at VEX competitions, it is <strong>VERY</strong> important that submissions be uniform.</p><br>
    <h5 id="gen">General</h5>
    <p>It is extremely important that all changes are documented in the engineering notebook. The system relies on having
      every single change<br>documented, so that only images taken <i>after the change</i> are needed. All changes in a given area in a single day should
      be condensed into <b>one submission</b>.<br> For example, if you modify the drivetrain and someone else modifies the lift,
      put both of those into the same notebook submission. If this sort of<br> situation occurs, make sure to credit everyone
      who worked on it in the submission, and to include images of all of the changes.<br>
      Also, please avoid using pronouns like "I" in the notebook. </p><br><br>
    <h5 id="markdown">Markdown</h5>
    <p>The submission box supports a simple formatting language called Markdown. It can be used to make text bold, italicized,
    or even format it as code.<br>Here are some of the more common formatting elements available in Markdown.</p>
    <table class="w3-table w3-bordered w3-border">
      <tr>
        <th>What you type:</th>
        <th>What you see:</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>**bolded**</td>
        <td><b>bolded<b></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>*italicized*</td>
        <td><i>italicized</i></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>`monospace`</td>
        <td><pre>monospace</pre></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>```language<br>code in that language<br>```</td>
        <td><pre><code>code in that language (with syntax highlighting)</code></pre></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>A reference containing more advanced features of Markdown can be found <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/">here.</a>
    <br>To the right of the submission form, you will see a real-time preview of how it will look in the actual notebook.</p><br><br>
    <h5 name="images">Images</h5>
    <p>If your submission includes modification to the robot or design, or creation of concept drawings you <strong>MUST</strong> submit images.<br>
      This is extremely important. Make a habit of taking these photos or screenshots <i>every time you make a modification.</i><br>
      Ensure that the images clearly show the change, and that they are <i>focused</i> and have <i>good lighting.</i> Only submit images from<br>
      after you make the modification, as if everyone is properly contributing, before images should already be available.</p><br><br>
    <h5 name="desc">Description</h5>
    <p>On the submission page is a large text box for describing your modification. In this area, you should describe both <br> why you made the
      change and what you changed. Not to sound like an english teacher, but it is large for a reason, so use detail and be specific.</p><br><br>
    <h5 name="name">Names</h5>
    <p>Please add the name of every student who participated in the modification that you are submitting. The names should <br>
    all be separated with a comma and a space. Do not put "and" in the list of names. </p>
